abstract: Recently, adversarial attacks have shown to lead the state-of-the-art
  deep neural networks (DNNs) to misclassification. However, most adversarial
  attacks are generated according to whether they are perceptual to human visual
  system, measured by geometric metrics such as the l2-norm, which ignores the
  common watermarks in cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose a fast
  adversarial watermark attack (FAWA) method based on fast differential
  evolution technique, which optimally superimposes a watermark on an image to
  fool DNNs. We also attempt to explain the reason why the attack is successful
  and propose two hypotheses on the vulnerability of DNN classifiers and the
  influence of the watermark attack on higher-layer features extraction
  respectively. In addition, we propose two countermeasure methods against FAWA
  based on random rotation and median filtering respectively. Experimental
  results show that our method achieves 41.3% success rate in fooling VGG-16 and
  have good transferability. Our approach is also shown to be effective in
  deceiving deep learning as a service (DLaaS) systems as well as the physical
  world. The proposed FAWA, hypotheses, and the countermeasure methods, provide
  a timely help for DNN designers to gain some knowledge of model vulnerability
  while designing DNN classifiers and related DLaaS applications.
