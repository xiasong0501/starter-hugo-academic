abstract: With the popularization of the internet, the media of advertising
  tends to diversify. Compared to traditional advertising methods, internet
  advertising is well received for its convenient and fast propagation mode.
  However due to its mandatory and invasive property, the publicity effect of
  internet advertising is greatly reduced. To make the delivery of Internet
  advertising more directional and efficient, we try to analyze the behavioral
  preferences of netizens from Beijing and Jinhua when using different Apps, and
  then conclude some rational delivery strategies for internet advertising
  investors. We use Multi-state Models (MSM) to construct an online Apps
  transfer model for netizens, which will help to get some intuitive
  conclusions. After that, basing on online apps transfer model, we adopt
  entropy method, hierarchical clustering, and Tucker decomposition to mine the
  potential behavioral preferences of netizens. Finally we provide some
  suggestions and references with the internet advertisers.
