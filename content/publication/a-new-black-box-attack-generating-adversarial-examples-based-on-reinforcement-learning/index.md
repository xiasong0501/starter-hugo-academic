abstract: Machine learning can be misled by adversarial examples, which is
  formed by making small changes to the original data. Nowadays, there are kinds
  of methods to produce adversarial examples. However, they can not apply
  non-differentiable models, reduce the amount of calculations, and shorten the
  sample generation time at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new black
  box attack generating adversarial examples based on reinforcement learning. By
  using deep Q-learning network, we can train the substitute model and generate
  adversarial examples at the same time. Experimental results show that this
  method only needs 7.7ms to produce an adversarial example, which solves the
  problems of low efficiency, large amount of calculation and inapplicable to
  non-differentiable model.
