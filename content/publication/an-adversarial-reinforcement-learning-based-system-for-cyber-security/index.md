abstract: "In this paper, we proposed a reinforcement learning based system for
  defending the network users from malicious network traffics. By training two
  reinforcement learning agents: network attack generation agent and network
  defense agent, and based on the environment of deep neural networks, this
  system not only aims to outperforme the traditional machine learning algorithm
  (such as CNNs and LSTM), but also can to detect the adversarial example, which
  is the one of the biggest challenges for current machine learning based
  intrusion detection system."
