I am a MSc student advised by Porf. Yap Kim Hui in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Nanyang Technological University. My expected graduation time is in May 2022. My research interests include Trustworthy & Robust AI and Data Analysis. Before my graduation study, I participated in projects about "Analysis of Chinese People's Online Preference" and "Adversarial Attack in Deep Learning", where I published two conference papers and one journal paper. 

Now, I am conducting the project about “Trustworthy AI” under the supervision of Prof. Yap Kim Hui, where I try to provide the certified defense for deep learning by statistic method.
