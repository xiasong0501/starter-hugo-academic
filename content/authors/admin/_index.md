I am a MSc student advised by Porf. Yap Kim Hui in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Nanyang Technological University. My expected graduation time is May 2022. Currently, my research interest is Trustworthy & Robust AI. Before that, I participated in projects "Analysis of Chinese People's Online Preference" and "Adversarial Attack in Deep Learning", where I published two conference papers and one journal paper. I also finished a draft paper about explainable maximizing certified defense under randomized smoothing, which is under revision for submission.

Now, I am conducting the research about “Trustworthy & robustness AI”, where my objective is solving the high-dimensional Gaussian data overlapping problem and enhancing models' certified robustness with randomized smoothing.
